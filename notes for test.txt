within rattle <- mixed data <- covert all to numerical (will introduce a lot of bias)
1st cluster on numerics within k-means
create new categorical variable using cluster ID base on this clustering
then cluster on categorical

association rules
practical challenge -> what is the level of granularity
	soda or orange vanilla coke or diet cherry pepsi
	SKUs aggregate or disaggregate so that items occur roughly in same number of transactions
	(same order of magnitude)
you could break down certain categories, but not all i.e. transaction soda happens an order of 
magintude more than all other items. So you break down soda
